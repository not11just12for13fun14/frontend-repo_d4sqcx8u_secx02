    "I’m a multidisciplinary visual designer specializing in brand identity, logos, social creatives, and UI/UX. I blend strategy with craft using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, and Procreate to create scalable systems and scroll-stopping visuals. Over the past few years, I’ve helped startups and established brands clarify their voice, simplify their look, and ship campaigns that perform. My work spans tech, lifestyle, and D2C — always with a focus on clarity, consistency, and measurable impact.",
